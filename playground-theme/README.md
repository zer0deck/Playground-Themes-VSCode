# Playground Theme by zer0deck (Light)

*This is simple and very colorfull theme for VSCode. Nothing special, don't worry, it won't kill your machine... or will it? Who knows...*

## Dark version

I've also made the dark variant with almost the same pallete to match this one. You can find it in my profile.
